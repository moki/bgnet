3 IP Addresses, structs, and Data Munging

3.1 IP Addresses v4, v6

The internet protocol version 4 - IPv4

addresses made up of four bytes(4 octets) separated by dots: 192.0.2.111
allows up to 2^32 unique addresses ~4bil

The internet protocol version 6 - IPv6

addresses made up of eight 2 bytes(16-bit) chunks in hex separated by colons:
2001:0db8:c9d2:aee5:73e3:934a:a5ae:9551
sequential 0's can be compressed between two colons, one can leave off leading
zeroes for each byte pair as an example:

explicit: 2001:0db8:c9d2:0012:0000:0000:0000:0051
implicit: 2001:db8:c9d2:12::51

explicit: 2001:0db8:ab00:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
implicit: 2001:db8:ab00::

explicit: 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
implicit: ::1

loopback address: ::1 known as localhost and represented in ipv4 as 127.0.0.1

ipv4 compatible mode for ipv6
::ffff:192.0.2.33

3.1.1 Subnets

Network portion of the ip address is called the netmask, which you bitwise and
with the ip address to get the network number out of it.

mask: 		255.255.255.0
ip address: 	192.0.2.12
network:	192.0.2.0
host:		12

representation convention:
<ip_address>/<number_of_network_bits_in_decimal>
ipv4
192.0.2.12/30
ipv6
2001:db8::/32
2001:db8:5413:4028::9db9/64

3.1.2 Port Numbers

16-bit number, that acts like address of the service.
port numbers < 1024 are considered special and requires special OS privileges.
listed in Big IANA Port List, on a unix: /etc/services
