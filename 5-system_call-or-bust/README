System calls or library calls that allow you to acess the network functionality

5.1 - getaddrinfo() - helps setup socket structs

BEFORE one used gethostbyname() to do DNS lookup, then load that info into
struct sockaddr_in by hand, and use that in your calls.
NOW getaddrinfo() does DNS and service name lookups.

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>

int getaddrinfo(const char *node,		// "example.com" or ip
		const char *service,		// "http" or port number
		const struct addrinfo *hints,
		struct addrinfo **res);

three input parameters:
node - host name to connect to or an ip address
service - port number "80" or name "http"/"ftp"(found in /etc/services)
hints - points to a struct addrinfo filled with already relevant information
returns a pointer to a linked-list res of results.

/client-tcp - sample code for tcp client setup
